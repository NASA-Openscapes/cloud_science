## Workshop:
A one day introduction to Python for oceanographers to introduce oceanographers to Python programming and reproducible research using Jupyter Notebooks, Git, software citations, and cloud computing.  This hands-on course will use common oceanographic research analyses to demonstrate capabilities of Python, open source software libraries, and cloud computing.
 
### Preliminary Schedule
- 09:00    Intro to the Python ecosystem and StackOverflow/Google - MGR
- 09:30    Introduction to Jupyter Notebook, basic python commands

- 10:30    Components of a Xarray dataset, reading, selecting, plotting, saving data (CG) 
- 11:00    Xarray:  regridding, interpolation (CG - compare toy weather group by to resample code)
- 12:00    Lunch break: discussion of open source software
- 13:00   Plot data and save figures
	Cartopy
	Example collocating cruise data with satellite data
- 14:00   PythonAnywhere cloud computing demo
- 15:00    Using Git
