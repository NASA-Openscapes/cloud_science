## Workshop:
A one day introduction to Python for oceanographers to introduce oceanographers to Python programming and reproducible research using Jupyter Notebooks, Git, software citations, and cloud computing.  This hands-on course will use common oceanographic research analyses to demonstrate capabilities of Python, open source software libraries, and cloud computing.
